        <p>Bali Blue Moon Single Origin, Dark Roast Coffee K-Cups by The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf yield coffee with a dark and distinctive flavor and fragrant aroma. Each box includes 10 K-Cup single serve pods.
            Gently nurtured in the lush Balinese highlands and expertly roasted in small batches to perfection, our Single Origin Bali Blue Moon Dark Roast Coffee delights with a fragrant toffee aroma, indulgent notes of chocolate and nuts, and a crisp black cherry finish.
            Our Bali Blue Moon coffee beans are grown at an altitude between 3200 and 3900 feet, under shade trees, with orange and tangerine trees planted between the rows of coffee. Harvesting is done from May to October when only ripe fruit is picked, and the coffee is then semi-washed with a two-step sun drying process. Expertly roasted in small batches for optimal taste and quality.
